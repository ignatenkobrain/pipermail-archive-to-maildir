I want to inhale the history of a mailing list stored in pipermail.

I find it tedious to read mailing list archive through pipermail's
web interface. I'd rather read them in mutt.

So I wrote a script to download the archives and put them in a maildir.

It's crap in oh so many ways, but it seems to work for me.

This is how one might use it:

    get-pipermail-files http://lists.wibble.com/pipermail/technica ~/Maildir/.technica

Then I can run:
  
    mutt -f ~/Maildir/.technica

(Or if you've configured mutt - as I have - to automatically look for
sub-maildirs beginning with a dot in ~/Maildir, then just "mutt -y")

--------
I also put this at the end of my .muttrc to make threading be sane.
I'm sure if I hacked the wd-mbox2maildir script, I wouldn't have to...

    set sort=threads
    set sort_aux=reverse-date
    unset strict_threads
    set sort_re=no
    set thread_received=no
